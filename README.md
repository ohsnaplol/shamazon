# Shamazon SQL DB Modifier
In order to learn SQL syntax, I created a database locally on my computer and created a 'customer' view and a 'manager' view to manipulate the data. 
The customer can purchase an item in the database by ID while the manager can add new products, add to existing inventory, and add new products to the database as well.

Check the YouTube link next to the description to see this program in action.
